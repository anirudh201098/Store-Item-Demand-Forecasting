# Store-Item-Demand-Forecasting
## Mission statement: 
A data science project for demand analysis of items in stores. The data is a multiple time series data where we have 500 sets of combinations for stores and items, and we are required to analyse them and forecast their future values.

Dataset: [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data)

## Procedure
We use train.csv which contains 5 years of sales for 50 items in 10 stores, from 2013 to 2017.
We use sales of the years 2013-2016 as train data and the sales of the year 2017 as test data.
There are 10 stores and 50 items. Sales are given for each item in each store, i.e. 500 sets of sales, each of 5 years.
Values of sale range from about 2 to 50.
